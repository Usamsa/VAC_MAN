You can adjust difficulty, speed in the Model.java or GameLoop.java file

```java

# speed
private static final int FPS = 60;
private static final double MS_PER_UPDATE = 1000.0 / FPS;

# adjusting difficulty through ghosts
private int[] ghost = { getPosition(5), getPosition(6), getPosition(7), getPosition(8) };

```

You can find more information in the src code itself :)
